* **Core Technologies**: TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Three.js/R3F, React Native
* **Additional Experience**: Vue, Angular.js, Knockout.js
* **Tools & Libraries**: react-query, tanstack-table, ag-grid, zustand, tailwindcss, ANTD
* **Specialized Skills**: Shader programming, View Transitions API, web crawlers, business analytics

**WORK EXPERIENCE**

**RekSoft           							    		       03.2021 – Current time**  
*Senior Frontend developer*

* SCADA system for [Sheremetyevo airport](https://www.svo.aero/en/main)


Led the development of a highly scalable, interactive airport map that renders thousands of moving objects with consistently high performance, even with disabled hardware acceleration. Wrote custom shaders to achieve better visualization of equipment status. Increased operator productivity by integrating predictive position updates for better tracking of moving objects. Engineered an intuitive, multi-layer system to navigate through complex, overlapping data. Reduced the number of calculations to a minimum and achieved stable performance even on the slowest devices.

Stack: TypeScript, Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Router, Tanstack react-query, Tailwind CSS.

* [S7 media](https://media.s7.ru/).

Built the media platform from scratch to production, taking an active part in the discussion of the main business features of the product. I engineered a solution that significantly improved navigation speed, leading to a 16.3% increase in user engagement and enhanced search engine rankings. I created an intuitive article editor for website visitors, enabling them to generate their own content, leading to a 19.2% increase in the number of posts. Implemented a cross-platform application (≈60% of the codebase is shared), which significantly reduced development costs for both Android and iOS versions.

Stack: TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Tanstack react-query, Zustand, Tailwind CSS.
